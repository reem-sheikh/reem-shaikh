I learnt coding pre-AI revolution, it taught me much on patience, perseverance and problem solving and how I can merge my art, writing and technical skills together. Although I'm also interested in automation and have created a contactless VMS QR Code based as a real time project for a gated society. 

While these coding projects are old, the process holds a special place in my heart.
Here you can check my coding progress at [70 Days Of Code](https://github.com/reem-shaikh/70DaysOfCode). 

> Here is a list of some of my projects:
- [Movie App](https://angry-villani-ca483a.netlify.app/) - React JS, material UI, axios, redux, omdb-api

My hobbies align towards writing, I've experimented in all these niches: Business Formal, Business Humor, Finance, Technology, Psychology, Legal, Digital Marketing, Investor pitches, Documentations. I would post on wattpad, medium, pinterest and twitter. I also upload my [adventure vlogs](https://vimeo.com/reemsheikh) on vimeo which is part of my passion project. 

I also love playing soccer, you'll find my [soccer inspired story](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxrP0kbDFMZ/) published @studentvillageindia. Since I was so passionate about soccer I ended up building a custom [soccer based management system](https://github.com/reem-shaikh/c-project) as a hobby project with file handling in CPP during my senior high. I've also biult Control Framework Hotel Management system during my undergrad and I created an audio hub for my final year.
In my pursuit of experimenting, I've learnt quite alot on the technical side of things, yet to learn more.
